# Hello!

### I am Matt Kostandin

...and I am a lucky man! I work with a great group of people at BOLD Laser Automation. Producing some of the finest automation systems in the world.

I began working with optics at UMASS Lowell where I studied lithography and photonics as an intern. Soon after, I was testing products on a workbench with an oscilloscope for one of the leading innovators in LED lighting. By the time I finished my first two degrees, I had already been working as an engineer with industrial lasers for nearly a year and I was hooked.

I have great fun contributing or working on my passion projects here on Github. Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope we get the opportunity to work with each other real soon. Happy Coding!
