# Welcome!
### I am Matt Kostandin
... and I am a lucky man! I work with a great group of people at BOLD Laser Automation. Producing some of the finest automation systems in the world.

I began working with optics at UMASS Lowell where I studied lithography and photonics as an intern. Soon after, I was testing products on a workbench with an oscilloscope for one of the leading innovators in LED lighting. By the time I finished my first two degrees, I had already been working as an engineer with industrial lasers for nearly a year and I was hooked.

I am always looking for opportunities to add to my long record of achieving personal goals and exceeding expectations be it joining university teams or working with other students on passion projects using FPGAs, Microcontrollers, or Web Development.
